# 1.1 DATA SCIENCE

What is data science? It is an interesting question and one without a widely accepted answer. Herein, we take a broad view that data science encompasses all work related to data. While this includes data analysis, it also takes in a host of other topics such as data cleaning, data curation, data ethics, research data management, etc...

THe place of statistics within the pantheon of data sicence is a topic on which much has been written. While statistics is certainly a very important part of data science, statistics should not be taken as synonymous with data science. Much has been written about the relationship between data science and statistics. On the one extreme, some might view data science -and data analysis, in particular- as a retrogression of statistics; yet, on the other extreme, some may argue that data science is a manifestation of what statistics was always meant to be. In reality, it is probably an error to try to compare statistics and data science as if they were alternatives. Herein, we consider that statistics plays a crucial role in data analysis, or data analytics, which in turn in a crucial part of the data science mosaic.


Contrasting data analysis and mathematical statistics, Hayashi (1998) writes: "... mathematical statistics have been prone to be removed from reality. On the other hand, the method of data analysis has developed in the fields disregarded by mathematical statistics and has given useful results to solve complicated problems based on mathematico-statistical methods (which are not always based on statistical inference but rather descriptive)"

The views expressed by Hayashi (1998) are not altogether different from more recent observations that, insofar as analysis is concerned, data science tends to focus on prediction, while statistics has focused on modelling and inference. That is not to say that prediction is not a part of inference but rather that prediction is a part, and not the goal, of inference. We shall return to this theme, i.e., inference versus prediction, several times within this monograph.

Breiman (2001b) writes incisively about two cultures in statistical modelling, and this work is wonderfully summarized in the first few lines of its abstract: "There are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data. One assumes that the data are generated by a given stochastic data model. The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems."

The viewpoint articulated here leans toward a view of data analysis as, at least partly, arising out of one culture in statistical modelling.
